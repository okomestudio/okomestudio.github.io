				<p>There are numerous pieces of duplicate information served by multiple
sources on the web. Many news stories that we receive from the media
tend to originate from the same source, such as the Associated
Press. When such contents are scraped off the web for archiving, a
need may arise to categorize documents by their similarity (not in the
sense of meaning of the text but the character-level or lexical
matching).</p>
<p>Here, we build a prototype for near-duplicate document detection
system. This article presents the background material on an algorithm
called MinHash and a method for probabilistic dimension reduction
through the locality-sensitive hashing. A future article presents
their implementation on Python and CouchDB.</p>
<p>(Note that all the numbers generated for the tables in this article
are totally made up for illustration purposes; they may not be
mathematically consistent with any hashing algorithm.)</p>
<h2 id="jaccard-similarity-index">Jaccard Similarity Index</h2>
<p>A similarity is represented by the Jaccard index:</p>
<p><code>\[ J(D_i, D_j) = \frac{|D_i \cap D_j|}{|D_i \cup D_j|} \]</code></p>
<p>where <code>$D_i$</code> and <code>$D_j$</code> are sets representing the two documents in our
context.</p>
<h2 id="shingling">Shingling</h2>
<p>A useful way to construct a set representing a document is by shingling. To
construct a set of <code>$k$</code>-singles from a text, a sliding window of <code>$k$</code>
characters is applied over the text. For example, if the text is “abcdabd,” the
resulting set of 2-shingles is {ab, bc, cd, da, bd} (note that “ab” appears only
once and not repeated in the set).</p>
<p>The value of <code>$k$</code> is arbitrary, but it should be large enough
that the probability of any given shingle appearing in any random
document is low. That is, if the available number of characters is
<code>$c$</code> and the character length of typical documents is <code>$l$</code>, we
should at least ensure <code>$c^k \gg l-k+1$</code>. Since each character has
a different frequency of appearance in a typical text, a suitable
value for <code>$k$</code> depends on the nature of documents and should be
tuned accordingly. A good rule of thumb for an order of magnitude
estimate is to assume <code>$c = 20$</code> for English texts.</p>
<p>Instead of using individual characters, shingles can also be
constructed from words. For example, in a math text book we may often
see a sentence beginning with a terse expression “it is trivial to
show,” whose 3-shingle set is {“it is trivial”, “is trivial to”,
“trivial to show”}. This has advantage in that shingles built this way
are more sensitive to the styles of writing. The style sensitivity may
aid in identifying similarities between domain-specific texts buried
in other types of documents.</p>
<h2 id="hashing-shingles">Hashing Shingles</h2>
<p>Typically, shingles are all hashed and grouped into buckets
represented by integer. The use of integer is a huge advantage in
terms of data compression. For example, a 4-shingle (of characters)
typically uses 4 bytes, each byte used for a character, and this is
good for representing <code>$160,000$</code> 4-shingles (i.e., <code>$20^4$</code>).
With a 4-byte, however, about 4 million (<code>$2^{32}$</code>)
integers and therefore shingles could be represented, which is good
enough size for <code>$k = 7$</code> (i.e., <code>$20^7$</code>). If a tiny
probability for collision into the same bucket can be tolerated,
<code>$k$</code> can be chosen even larger. From here on, we assume a random hash
function does not produce any collision between any pair of randomly
chosen shingles, i.e., the mapping <code>$s_i \rightarrow h(s_i)$</code>
yields a unique integer.</p>
<h2 id="characteristic-matrix">Characteristic Matrix</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a random hash function <code>$h(s)$</code> and all possible
singles <code>$s_1$</code>, <code>$s_2$</code>, <code>$\dots$</code>, <code>$s_m$</code> from
<code>$D_1$</code>, <code>$D_2$</code>, <code>$\dots$</code>, <code>$D_l$</code> for a total of <code>$l$</code>
documents. We can summarize this in a characteristic matrix:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>where the entry of 1 indicates that the document <code>$D_j$</code> contains
a shingle <code>$s_i$</code> for which a hash value <code>$h(s_i)$</code>
exists. (The entry of 0 means the shingle itself does not appear in
that document.) It is trivial to compute Jaccard indices using any
pair of documents from this matrix. In practice, however, the
requirement for comparing all the hash values for a large number of
documents makes the process prohibitive.</p>
<h2 id="minhash-as-a-jaccard-index-estimator">MinHash as a Jaccard Index Estimator</h2>
<p>Let us focus on a pair of documents, <code>$D_1$</code> and <code>$D_2$</code>, for
which the shingles <code>$s_1$</code>, <code>$s_2$</code>, <code>$\dots$</code>, <code>$s_7$</code>
have been hashed by a function <code>$h$</code>. The relevant entries from the
characteristic matrix look as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are three types of rows: (a) both columns have 1, (b) one of the
columns has 1, and (c) both columns have 0. We let <code>$X$</code>, <code>$Y$</code>,
and <code>$Z$</code> denote the numbers of rows categorized this way,
respectively. For <code>$D_1 = \left\{h(s_2), h(s_3), h(s_5), h(s_7)\right\}$</code>
and <code>$D_2 = \left\{ h(s_3), h(s_4), h(s_7)\right\}$</code>,
<code>$X$</code> is the cardinality of their joint set
and <code>$Y$</code> is that for their union. Hence the Jaccard index is
<code>$X / (X + Y) = 2/5 = 0.4$</code>.</p>
<p>Now, consider an experiment in which the rows in the matrix are
randomly permutated. Remove the rows of type (c), since they do not
contribute at all to the union of two sets. We look at the first row
of the matrix thus constructed and note its type defined above, either
(a) or (b). Repeat the process n times. What is the chance that the
first row found this way to be of type (a) above? The probability is
given by <code>$X / (X + Y)$</code>, which is similar to the way Jaccard
index is computed. This is the property that we use as a Jaccard index
estimator.</p>
<p>In practice, randomly permuting a huge number of rows is very
inefficient. Instead, we prepare a set of random hash functions
<code>$h_i(s)$</code> (for <code>$i = \left\{1, 2, \dots, n\right\}$</code> for a
set of <code>$n$</code> measurements) that effectively permute the row order given
the same set of shingles and sort rows in ascending order by hash
values. (In order for this to be true, the hash functions need to be
well-chosen and produce few collisions.) The row of the minimum hash
value corresponds to picking the first row in the example above.</p>
<p>What we have shown is that, for estimating Jaccard indices, we only
need to keep the minimum hash values generated from <code>$n$</code> different hash
functions. Therefore the very sparse characteristic matrix can be
condensed into a signature matrix of minimum hash values with entries
given by</p>
<p><code>\[ h_i \equiv \min \left\{h_i(s_1), h_i(s_2), \dots, h_i(s_m)\right\} \ , \]</code></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><code>\[ D_j = \left\{ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m \right\} \]</code></p>
<p>is the set of shingles from the document <code>$D_j$</code>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For supposedly near-duplicate documents such as <code>$D\_j$</code> and
<code>$D_{j+1}$</code> in the table, most MinHash values are similar, and the
fraction of values that are similar is an estimate of the Jaccard
index. This is the gist of the MinHash algorithm. In other words, the
probability <code>$p$</code> that a pair of MinHash values from two documents
<code>$D_i$</code> and <code>$D_j$</code> match is equivalent to their Jaccard
index:</p>
<p><code>\begin{equation} p = J(D_i, D_j) \ . \label{eq:equality} \end{equation}</code></p>
<h2 id="locality-sensitive-hashing">Locality-Sensitive Hashing</h2>
<p>While the information necessary to compute document similarity have
been compressed quite nicely into a signature matrix, examining all
documents would take <code>$l(l-1)/2$</code> pairs, each involving <code>$n$</code>
comparisons from signature entries. The vast majority of documents may
not be near-duplicate, however, and in such a case we do not need
every pair to be compared. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) offers a
method of reducing the number of dimensions in high-dimensional
MinHash signatures.</p>
<p>The idea is to partition a MinHash signature matrix into b bands, each
with <code>$r$</code> rows (such that <code>$n = b r$</code> is the total number of
rows), and hashing MinHash integer sequences grouped by band. For
example, if we have <code>$n = 12$</code> MinHash values, we could partition
them into <code>$b = 3$</code> bands of <code>$r = 4$</code> rows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then we use some good hash function <code>$H$</code> which takes <code>$r$</code>
MinHash values and summarizes into integers, <code>$H(h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4) \equiv H_1$</code> for band 1, <code>$H(h_5, h_6, h_7, h_8) \equiv H_2$</code>
for band 2, and so on. This reduces the <code>$n \times l$</code> signature
matrix into <code>$b \times l$</code> matrix:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Near-duplicate documents will be hashed into the same bucket within
each band. In this example, <code>$D\_j$</code> and <code>$D\_{j+1}$</code> are in
the same bucket for bands 1 and 2. (Note that <code>$D\_1$</code> in band 3
has the same hash value as <code>$D\_j$</code> and <code>$D_{j+1}$</code> in band 2,
but they are not considered to be in the same bucket since the bands
are different.) The documents that share a bucket within a band is
considered candidates for further examination. The advantage is that,
since <code>$b \ll n$</code> in general, the number of required comparisons
is much smaller. The LSH thus provides a way to select out candidates
for near-duplicate detection, before full signature comparisons are
carried out.</p>
<p>The assumption is that a pair of documents, if near-duplicate, has a
total of b chances to be hashed into a common bucket in at least one
of the available bands. Recall from Eq. <code>$\eqref{eq:equality}$</code> that the probability that
a pair of MinHash values from two documents match is equivalent to
their Jaccard index. The probability that a pair of documents share a
bucket in a band of <code>$r$</code> rows is given by <code>$p^r$</code>. Its
complement, <code>$1 - p^r$</code>, is the probability that a document pair
does not get hashed into the same bucket for a band. Then the
probability that two documents become candidates in at least one band
is given by <code>$1 - (1 - p^r)^b$</code>. Plotting for varying <code>$b$</code>
and <code>$r$</code>, the function forms a series of S-curves:</p>
<p><img src="prob-vs-jaccard.png" alt="Probability of Being Chosen as Candidates vs. Jaccard
Index"></p>
<p>The figure provides an intuition as to how the value of <code>$b$</code> and
<code>$r$</code> should be chosen for a target Jaccard similarity threshold
<code>$t$</code> (above which two documents are considered
near-duplicate). Let <code>$f(p) = 1 - (1-p^r)^b$</code>. The value of <code>$p$</code>
for the steepest slope is obtained from the second derivative,
<code>$d^2f/dp^2 |_{p=p_t} = 0$</code>, which is</p>
<p><code>\[ p_t = \left(\frac{r-1}{br-1}\right)^{1/r}    \approx \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^{1/r} \]</code></p>
<p>for <code>$b$</code>, <code>$r \gg 1$</code>. As a rule of thumb, we want <code>$p_t \approx t$</code>, but the exact value of <code>$p_t$</code> can be adjusted
based on rejection criteria. Choosing <code>$p_t &gt; t$</code> reduces false
positives, whereas <code>$p_t &lt; t$</code> reduces false negatives at the
candidate selection step.</p>
