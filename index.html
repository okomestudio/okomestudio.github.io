  <h2>Creativity Meets Science</h2>

  <p>Okome Studio is a San Francisco-based software technology service
    consultancy. Its focus is on data analysis and data software
    product development. It is a mom-and-pop (more like a single dude)
    development studio founded by Taro Sato, a scientist by nature and
    a programmer by experience, to realize his passion for building
    data software products from the ground up under lean principles.</p>

  <h2>What is behind Okome?</h2>

  <img src="image/kome.jpg" class="img_right" alt="well-cooked okome" title="well-cooked okome" />

  <p>Short-grain Japonica white rice, okome has been the staple of
    Japan with over 2,000 years of history. Served warm and fluff,
    okome alone tastes plain and basic, yet it enhances the flavor of
    any accompanying dish. Okome serves as a canvas for other food to
    express their distinct personalities. It is self-effacing yet
    ubiquitous. It is simple yet beautiful and fundamental.</p>

  <p>Just like arts and sciences, okome is a foundation of life. Okome
    Studio aspires to provide services through ingeneous combination
    of science, engineering, and design where creative minds meet
    scientific thought process and together brew entrepreneurial
    innovations that build foundations of quality life.</p>

  <h2>About Taro Sato</h2>

  <img src="image/taro.jpg" class="img_left" alt="Taro" title="Taro" />

  <p>Born in Saitama, Japan and raised in the New York Metro area,
    Taro Sato has been in a perpetual love-hate relationship with
    computers. What started out as a desire to create Nintendo-like
    8-bit games by BASIC and hand-written assembly turned into a
    profession of number crunching using the latest of software
    technology. More recently, Taro has worked as a data scientist and
    software engineer for San Francisco/Silicon Valley startups. He
    has over 15 years worth of experience building and using
    scientific computing tools in both academia and industry. An avid
    user of open-source development environment and adoring the UNIX
    philosophy, Taro enjoys installing Debian Linux on all his
    ThinkPads at home.</p>

  <p>Taro holds a Ph.D. in physics and has done academic research in
    condensed-matter physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. He has
    analyzed some of the largest observational data in astrophysics
    using high-performance computing facility. The opportunities to
    analyze electromagnetic signals from distant objects from the far
    reaches of the universe has been the greatest privilege of his
    life.</p>

  <p>In his free time, Taro enjoys baseball and post-disco funk music
    from the late-1970s to early-1980s. An avid reader of random
    books, he is often found in cafes in San Francisco reading about
    the richness of life through the eyes of science and worrying
    about an extra sip of coffee preventing him from ever recovering
    from the late-stage insomnia. Online, Taro frequents quality
    Q&amp;A sites such
    as <a href="http://www.quora.com/Taro-Sato">Quora</a> reading and
    writing about Japanese culture and language among other
    topics; <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/243307">StackExchange</a>
    is another one of his favorite sites:
